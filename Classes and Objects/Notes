"""
Class:
is a programmer defined daata type that 
allows you to break up your program into more manageable pieces. 
Classes are made up of attributes that store information about the 
object (the things the object has), and methods to access or alter 
the objects data (the things the object does).  A class acts as a 
sort of template that allows you to create one or more objects from it.
It also allows you to write code that can easily be reused for multiple
programs.
"""

"""
Classes are particularly useful in larger projects, especially when
the project needs to be updated or maintained often. Classes allow for
ENCAPSULATION, ABSTRACTION, COHESION, EXTENSION and REUSE.
"""

"""
Object:
is an instance of a class. Objects are created in your program
and rea manipulated by using the objects's methods, which are defined
inside of a class. These methods can access and change the object's attributes
"""

"""
Self:
represents the instance of the class (the current object) that the method is
being called on. It is used to specify that this method is called on objects,
and it allows you to access the class's attributes. it is always the first
parameter in an instance method, and while it is not required that it be named
'self', it is recommended, since that is what other programmers will recognize it as.
